Welcome to the "HTML and CSS Projects" Repository!

Hi there! This is my place to store all the coding projects I'm working on during The Tech Academy's HTML and CSS course.

What's Inside?

Exercises: Here, you'll find small coding exercises I've done to practice HTML and CSS concepts.

Assignments: This folder contains bigger tasks assigned by my course instructors.

Projects: Check out the larger and more complex coding projects I've completed to apply what I've learned.

Why GitHub Matters

GitHub helps me keep track of my code changes and collaborate with others. It's a vital tool for creating an online portfolio to show my coding skills.

Stay Tuned for Updates!

I'll keep adding my latest projects and assignments as I progress through the course. Thanks for visiting and feel free to give feedback!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
